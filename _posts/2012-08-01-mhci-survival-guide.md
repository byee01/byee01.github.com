1. **Work-life balance? Ha!**

    Carnegie Mellon is a funny school. By now you've probably heard horror stories about the piles of work and sleepovers at the lab. Work-life balance at CMU doesn't mean what it means at other schools.

    At Carnegie Mellon, work-life balance is doing work _and_ life. Yes, you can do both. Don't swing too hard one way without making sure you temper it with some fun - because living at the lab sucks (although if you do, there are showers in the basement).

2. **Document everything.**

    Everything, seriously. Every meeting, send out a 1-paragraph summary. Every time you talk with the client or have a faculty meeting, write up a changelist and conclusions from the discussion. This isn't just for the Capstone either. Save your sketches and comment your code. It'll help you and help the poor TAs grading your stuff.

3. **Get a camera. Use it.**

    There's a ton of emphasis on documentation in the program. One thing that makes it easier is having a nice camera. For the second half of our capstone project, my team used a DSLR that made visuals for our report and presentation far more compelling.

4. **Eat lots.**

    Pittsburgh is an awesome food city.

    * [Las Palmas](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=3210670172531731074), 15 minute walk - a tiny Mexican supermarket and deli. From lunch til about 9pm, they cook up awesome $2 tacos from a stand right outside, nada de espa√±ol requerido. For the Californians, it's probably your best bet of getting your taco fix without having to go to the Strip.

5. **Be a part of the campus community.**

    Paint the fence. Watch a buggy race. Explore the booths during [Carnival](http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/society/2012/spring/as-seen-on-tv.shtml).
