## Impressions of Keynote from a hardcore InDesign User ##

Ever since I first started taking design courses, I've made presentations in InDesign. PowerPoint is long gone - once you're in a class full of designers you're in the big leagues. It's not so much that it lacks functionality - it's far easier to insert presentation elements such as builds and transitions using PowerPoint. But InDesign offers an enormous amount of control over all aspects of a document's appearance, particularly in regards to typography. And like all Adobe products, it hogs memory and crashes whenever you think about saving, so it's only natural that designers would gravitate towards it. [^foot]
